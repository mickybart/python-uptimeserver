Docker
------

This part can be extracted to a new project to manage your own Uptime Server deployment
with custom Config and secrets management.

Create an image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash
    
    export VERSION=1
    docker build -t uptime-server:$VERSION .

Prerequisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to add 2 files on this project to build the docker image :

- kubeconfig.txt
- secret.json

kubeconfig.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

kubeconfig.txt is a configuration file generated by kubectl to connect to kubernetes. Please read the documentation of kubectl.

Under GNU/Linux, this is the file located at ~/.kube/config but you should create a specific kube config by using rbac and limited credentials to your cluster.

secret.json
^^^^^^^^^^^

Check the README.rst on the root of the project.
